## Project Overview

Instylo is a feature-rich social media application that combines traditional social networking functionality with innovative educational and community features. The project aims to create a platform where users can connect, share content, study together, explore communities, access news, play games, and more.

This web application is built using modern web technologies, focusing on a responsive and engaging user experience. It leverages Appwrite as a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) solution, React for the frontend, and incorporates various third-party APIs to provide a comprehensive set of features.

The platform is designed for users who want more than just a conventional social media experience, offering specialized tools for education, community building, e-commerce, and entertainment.

## State Management

### Global State (React Context)

The application uses React Context API for managing global state:

#### `AuthContext`

Manages user authentication state.

**Key Features:**

- Current user information
- Authentication status
- Login/logout functions
- Token management

### Server State (React Query)

React Query is used for managing server state:

#### Key Query Hooks

- `useGetPosts`: Fetches posts for the feed
- `useGetUserById`: Retrieves specific user information
- `useLikePost`: Handles post liking functionality
- `useGetCurrentUser`: Fetches current user data
- `useGetRecentPosts`: Fetches most recent posts

### Local Component State

Individual components manage their own state using React's `useState` and `useReducer` hooks.

---

## Authentication

The application uses Appwrite for authentication services:

### Authentication Flow

1. User submits credentials via SigninForm or SignupForm
2. Credentials are validated and sent to Appwrite
3. Appwrite returns user information and session token
4. Token is stored (via `AuthContext`)
5. Authenticated user can access protected routes

### Protected Routes

Routes that require authentication are wrapped in a protection layer that redirects unauthenticated users to the login page.

---

## API Integration

### 1. Appwrite API

Appwrite serves as the backend for core functionality:

#### `appwriteConfig.ts`

Configuration file that initializes Appwrite services.

**Services Used:**

- **Authentication**: User management and sessions
- **Database**: Storing posts, comments, and other data
- **Storage**: Handling media uploads (images)

### 2. NewsAPI Integration

The application fetches news content from NewsAPI:

#### Direct Integration (Development)

In development mode, the frontend directly calls NewsAPI endpoints.

#### Serverless Proxy (Production)

In production, requests are routed through a Vercel serverless function (`/api/news`) to avoid CORS issues and work around NewsAPI's domain restrictions.

### 3. FreeToGame API via RapidAPI

The Games feature uses the FreeToGame API through RapidAPI:

#### `Games.tsx`

Implements fetching and displaying game data from the RapidAPI-hosted FreeToGame API.

**Implementation Details:**

- Uses environment variables for API keys
- Implements filtering and searching functionality
- Handles loading and error states

### 4. Jitsi Meet Integration

The Video Call feature integrates with Jitsi Meet for video conferencing:

#### `VideoCall.tsx`

Implements a video call interface using Jitsi Meet iframe integration.

**Key Features:**

- Room creation and joining
- Invitation link sharing
- Simple interface for video calls

---

## Deployment

The application is deployed using Vercel:

### Deployment Configuration

- **vercel.json**: Configuration file for Vercel deployment
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive keys and configuration stored in Vercel's environment variables

### Serverless Functions

Vercel serverless functions are used to:

- Proxy API requests (e.g., NewsAPI)
- Perform server-side operations without a dedicated backend
